# AWS Punting Plan JSON generation

Here are attempts at (semi)automatedly generating JSON manifests for collections being prepped for AWS from hashdeep manifest files.

Included in this folder are:
* `hashdeep_to_json.py`: python script that generates JSON from hashdeep and user-supplied input
* `mathtest.txt`: dummy hashdeep file for testing purposes
* `math_json_draft.txt`: sample output from `hashdeep_to_json.py` and `mathtest.txt`
* `previous_drafts`: older attempts, kept for historical purposes only
