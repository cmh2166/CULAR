* This is a proof of concept of the manifest template with data from the first round of Africana assets.
* Since fixity information is scattered in a few places for these assets, a lot has been hardcoded/hacked to make this work for these assets.
* Several adjustments to the template have been made to align with arrangement of other deposits already in CULAR.
* Thoughts, ideas, edits, welcome. (Dianne)
