# Migration to the new manifest format

## CULAR

Can probably derive most information from file names, in some cases may need to look at documentation. Would have to generate `package_id` values.

Erin would like to think about Lindsay Cooper collection. Questions about how we define packages for material we get as large sets of files without control over the file naming and structure, follows also for archival storage with IPP.

## Archival Storage

(Set Kheel and arXiv aside for now)

Would be good to develop script that does a dry run of package creation base on a complete file listing of archival storage content.
